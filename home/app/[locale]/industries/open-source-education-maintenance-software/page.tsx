      question: "How does QPM handle limited school budgets?",
      answer:
        "Unlike proprietary software, QPM is open-source. You save on recurring per-user seats, allowing you to reallocate those funds toward actual facility repairs and school supplies.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we manage multiple school sites in one instance?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Our hierarchical asset system allows you to manage an entire district or university system, with permission levels specific to each building’s maintenance lead.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is student data protected?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. By self-hosting QPM, you have 100% ownership of your data. There is no third-party access to your facility records or staff lists.",
