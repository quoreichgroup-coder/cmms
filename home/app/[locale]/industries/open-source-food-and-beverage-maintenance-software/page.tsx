        "Food and beverage operations require strict hygiene, traceability, and equipment reliability. A CMMS centralizes maintenance planning, inspections, and asset history to ensure safety, compliance, and continuous production.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can QPM support regulatory compliance and audits?",
      answer:
        "Yes. QPM stores maintenance records, inspection reports, and corrective actions, helping teams prepare for food safety audits and regulatory requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is QPM suitable for refrigerated and cold-chain equipment?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. QPM tracks maintenance schedules, failures, and spare parts for refrigeration and temperature-sensitive assets to reduce spoilage risks.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can QPM be deployed on-premise in food factories?",
      answer:
        "Yes. QPM is fully self-hosted and Docker-ready, making it ideal for facilities with strict security, privacy, or network isolation requirements.",
